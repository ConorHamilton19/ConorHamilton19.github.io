### Learning is fun...

Creating your own program is tough! It requires a lot more foresight and planning than I first realized. Working through my first major programming project there were a few big ideas that stood out to me:

1. **Start at the end and work backwards.** Words to live by and a lesson that this project helped me learn through a few hours of pain and struggle. Even after applying this process not everything always went smoothly but I guess that is just what it takes to learn something new. Not taking this into account on the first day of my project caused me to scrap the whole idea because it was just not moving towards the goal I had set in my mind. On the second day I put down what I wanted my end result to be in a notes folder and from there I moved efficiently through some major parts of the project. 
 
2. **Understand the goal of the project *thoroughly* before making too many big descisions.** The second major lesson that this project pushed into my head. After reading through the ReadMe and watching some of the videos I was quickly onto starting to peice together what would eventually become my project. I should have taken a bit more time to look at other projects and understand the goal of scraping a 'list' as well as able to drill down deeper into it. For my project I chose a weather site which seemed a little different than the other ideas I had seen, so it intrigued me. Moving throught the project and I was cruising along when it hit me, this website I am scraping does not have a list of cities or anything that I can scrape to add that 'list' functionality to my project. Each webpage for each city has to be searched through the search bar. Though I was able to add that function through some hard coding, it does not have the same syntactic sugar that I would have liked to be able to add. Having instances of cities that were generated from that list with their URL set as an attribute would have allowed me to expand much further, use the classes better and use iteration quite a bit more. If I could of have just followed both lessons 1 and 2 I would have been in a much better spot in making my code not just prettier but also way more functional. 

Though these are not the only things that I learned doing my first major project, they are what really stuck out and I think will help me move through more difficult projects to come.
