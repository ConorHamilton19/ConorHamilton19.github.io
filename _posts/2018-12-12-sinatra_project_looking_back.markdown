This project was full of lessons for me. Not all of it had to do with the technical aspect of coding. I have come to realize that these projects teach me so much about the web development process because of "dive into the deep end" aspect of completing them start to finish. 

## Lesson 1: Life will get in the way if you let it.
During the last few months I have taken a step back in my process to learn how to code. I recently moved accross the world, back from Australia to the Chicago area. This move definitely has taken its toll on me in more ways than one. Getting back in contact with my old life left me distracted and not spending as much time on my computer. Through this ordeal I have found that just spending at least a little time everyday going over what I have learned in this course or trying to finish a lab puts my brain in a state of retention. I am able to remember and apply lessons that I learned months ago much more easily and much faster. After spending a few months off I had found that I had to go back and go over everything that I had flown through a few months prior. Though it comes back quicker than when I originally learned it, it is still a hassle to rework labs that I had already completed. The time it took me to finish this project is definitely proof of this. 

## Lesson 2: MVC is complicated and simple at the same time.
Like many aspects of coding that I have learned about so far, the Model-View-Controller system is very complicated when first diving into it. There are so many new concepts that come out of that first look at MVC. Each part of the web application has rules and languages that go along with it. Along with that, an understanding of how the internet works is needed to create an application in this structure. So the when looking at this concept as a whole it seems like a lot of information. My favorite part about coding so far and how this course teaching it is that when broken down into seperate parts, it is usually fairly simple. A session is just an ID stored in a cookie to pass information accross the stateless internet, models interact with the database to save an arrange data so that it can be accessed, and views are just usually some html and css(a little bit of ruby) to display information from the databases and accept user input. Simple ideas that when stacked on top of each other create a much more complicated product.

## Lesson 3: Git is important!
Working on the Learn platform this far has made getting into how text editors and command lines work much simpler than it could be, but it has also coddled me. Not having to interact with git and github on a daily basis has turned it into a much more complicated idea than I think it really is. These projects force understanding of a process usually handled by Learn. After not pushing to git on a regular enough basis I had lost a small amount of my project that was never recovered. After a lesson like that I started to see why and how this system of backing up locally and remotely works together to save projects. As they get larger I am sure I will run into more things that need to be explored but for now my understanding is growing. 

All in all this project has once again pushed me harder and further than most of the other labs combined.
