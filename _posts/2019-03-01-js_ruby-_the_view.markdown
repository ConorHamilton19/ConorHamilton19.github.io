Javascript and AJAX seem to take coding and especially Ruby web development to another level. To this point it seems that this level is mostly something that affects user experience more than anything. The ability to hijack click events and dynamically change web pages without having to fire a 'get' request for the entire page is a revelation. I know I am only in the very beginning steps of learning what JS is really capable of but it is easy to see how immense the potential is. 

One spot that is especially interesting when talking about JS and Ruby is how they intersect in the views. Up to this point ERB has been a lifesaver. Allowing me to use ruby code to generate html. But as the JS project has progressed I have begun to find limitations in trying to implement these simultaneously. I believe one of the major issues is not having a plan for JS from the beginning. This project having us just add on JS at the end of a Rails project both makes it simpler in the fact that there is already a backend to work with but more complicated because of the design and user interface has to be changed and modified in more of a Frankenstein way than a truly planned out application. But all in all I can still see the potential it has to create a more complex and usable web app. 

Things are starting to get exciting. Moving to more functionality and interactivity is always fun. I understand that knowing the basics and foundations is very important to become a decent programmer in any language but looking forward a bit and seeing what JS truly has to offer in the case of single page applications and design is pumping me up!
